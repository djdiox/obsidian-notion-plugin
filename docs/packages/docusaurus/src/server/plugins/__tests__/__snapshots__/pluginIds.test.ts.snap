To use the same plugin multiple times on a Docusaurus site, you need to assign a unique ID to each plugin instance.

The plugin ID is "default" by default. It's possible that the preset you are using already includes a plugin instance, in which case you either want to disable the plugin in the preset (to use a single instance), or assign another ID to your extra plugin instance (to use multiple instances)."
